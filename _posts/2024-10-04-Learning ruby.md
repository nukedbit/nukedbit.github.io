# Introduction

After watching the interview with DHH by the YouTuber/streamer @ThePrimeagen, I completely agreed with everything DHH said.

# A short history of my career

Web technologies and software development have become increasingly complex. Whenever I have a project idea, I often hesitate to proceed because I anticipate the challenges involved in setting up even the most basic components, such as authentication and email functionalities for password resets. These are fundamental features of any web application. As a developer with expertise in C#, I also have extensive experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Swift, and PHP. However, I do not have experience with Java.

While framework like Blazor in .NET has really simplified web development, there is always some shit that get in your way, and you quickly end up wasting half or an entire day on stuff you could care less.

In the past, I consistently overlooked learning Ruby. The reason was straightforward: I work as a software developer in Italy. When I began my career in 1999, most companies were focused on point-and-click applications and predominantly used Windows. At that time, Linux posed significant challenges.

For further context, during that period in Italy, the majority of companies relied on technologies such as Visual Basic, Borland Delphi, and ASP for web applications. While some companies did use Java, C, and C++, most job opportunities were centered around developing desktop GUI applications.

Being a junior self taught developer at the time i also enjoyed developing small games using Dark Basic from TheGameCreators, BlitzMax, PureBasic, Delphi.

Then on 2001 a beta preview of Visual Studio .NET came out, it was the new shiny thing on the market, finally you could use either Visual Basic .NET or the new C# (Java). It was a great improvement on what was around at the time. Now i can create windows app that look great on windows, and with nice programming languages, the fast apps startup and no input lag, thanks god I managed to avoid a future of pain on Java Swing.
 
Now more than 20 years later I have been using MacOS as my main OS for 4+ years, .NET is cross platform and you can use real IDE's like jetbrains that really deliver on their promises.

So things have changed over the years, now as a Software Architect for multiple customers, I can choose my stack, and I thought why not let's give ruby and ruby on rails a try. Maybe i could finally a language and ecosystem that I enjoy working on.
While I still like C#, whenever you try to develop something new, there is always something that don't work as expected and you end up wasting hours for something that should work out of the box.

# How was the first impression?

I went on configuring Ruby using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) which is a multiple version manager for ruby and nodesjs.
Then installed rails from rubygems. Then followed official instruction to create my first rails project.

I can now see by just opening the new project the philosophy behind it, you get everything that you need to start working, a full test suite, you have pre generated examples on how to setup integration tests and functional tests.

In progress ...
